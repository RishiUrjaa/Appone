    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don&rsquo;t agree with the new Terms, you are free
            to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the
            Application.&nbsp; If you use the Application in any way after a change to the Terms
            is effective and notice has been provided, that means you agree to all the
            changes.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except for changes by us as described here, no other
            amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and
